# Using-Networks-to-Visualize-Ethnographic-Data

This is a collaborative project with Kenneth R. Hanson. We are interested in investigating how social network visualizations can yield insights into how participants relate to each other, as well as to shared cultural references. In so doing, we seek to contribute to ethnographic methodology by illuminating the social organization of respondents as well as the extent to which shared cultural references influence how respondents interpret their social worlds and practices.
